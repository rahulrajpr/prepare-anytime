I bring over 7 years of experience in data analytics and engineering, having worked in roles such as Business Analyst, Data Analyst, and Data Engineer. My focus has been on building reliable data pipelines and enabling clear reporting and business insights.

My experience includes SQL, Python, AWS, Redshift, Snowflake, Spark, dbt, and Airflow. In previous roles, I improved data processing efficiency, reduced costs, and migrated legacy systems to more streamlined solutions. I have also partnered with business and technical teams to translate requirements into practical data solutions.

I started my career as a Civil Engineer in 2012 and later transitioned into data, driven by my interest and passion for the field. Outside of work, I enjoy watching and playing cricket, and I spend time learning new skills, mostly through online courses on platforms like Udemy.
